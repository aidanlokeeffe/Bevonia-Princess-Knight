# Bevonia-Princess-Knight
This is a copy of the platformer Bevonia: Princess Knight. The original respository was owned by Ravi Goparaju; I just wanted to have a copy in case he made it private.

This work was completed in the Fall of 2018 for CS 329E: Elements of Game Design, taught at the University of Texas at Austin by Professor Paul Toprac. It was done in partnership with Ravi Goparaju and Zee Hussain.
